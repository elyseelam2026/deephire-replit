🤔 Clarifying Questions Before I Build:
1. Search & Discovery Model
•	Search Interface: Do clients search our candidate database (like LinkedIn) OR do we scrape/discover candidates on-demand per search?
o	Option A: Pre-populated database of candidates (we scraped 10,000+ profiles already)
o	Option B: On-demand discovery (client searches "CFO at PE firms" → we scrape LinkedIn then)
o	Option C: Hybrid (database + on-demand enrichment)

We won’t start with an empty database.  When client opens an account, more or less they will have some database to import to
We will (with the assistance of AI + manual) to do research according to industry.  
We will invite candidates to register here to provide another rich pool of database. 
We will know more candidates by viewing registered candidates’ network. 


2. Candidate Database Source
•	Where do candidates come from? Similar to Linkedin.com on one’s own accord + sending invitation (because we will do research) 
•	
o	From our company intelligence scraping (org charts)?  No. 
o	From LinkedIn searches we run? Yes 
o	Candidates sign up themselves? Yes
o	All of the above? Yes
o	
3. Credit/Charging Mechanism
•	What consumes credits?
o	Each candidate profile viewed?
o	Each search query?
o	Each contact/InMail sent?
o	Candidate profile enrichment (scraping LinkedIn, bio generation)?
•	How do we calculate "search difficulty"?
o	Senior roles = more credits?
o	Geographic scope?
o	AI processing required?

I need time to think about this the charging model or you can also give me some advice. 
o	
4. Contact/Outreach
•	How do clients contact candidates? To send email or call
o	Email through our platform? Yes 
o	Mail integration? Yes 
o	Just reveal contact info and client reaches out directly? Yes if client paid
•	Do we track responses/engagement? Yes 

5. Recruiter Role in This Model
Since you said "eliminate recruiters," what happens to the recruiter portal we built?
•	Is it for DeepHire admins only? Yes 
•	Or do some companies still want managed service (hybrid model)? Yes clients need recruiters to do closing, then they can hire us to do the rest of the process with full fee.  
•	Or delete it entirely? No.
