Got it — and thank you for sharing the whole debate.
Let me give you a clean, strategic recommendation — from a product, pricing, and headhunter’s perspective (so this fits your workflow, not just engineering logic).

⭐ My Clear Recommendation
Search depth should never be priced by volume.
It should be priced by difficulty + value.

Because:

Finding 8 elite candidates (CFO-level, 85–90% fit) is hard and high value.

Finding 100+ mid-fit profiles is cheap and easy because the long tail is mostly noise.

So you were totally right to say the previous logic “makes no sense” — because it’s backwards. The system was basically charging you more to find junk.

⭐ The Pricing & Tiering Model I Recommend You Should Adopt

This is the simplest, most intuitive structure that you, as a headhunter, and your clients will 100% understand:

1. Elite Targeted Search (premium)
Tier: Elite 8

Hard-skill fit: ≥88%

Candidate target: 8

Max: 10

Price: $149

Use case: PE CFO, Group CFO, COO, Fund Partner, MD

Tier: Elite 15

Hard-skill fit: ≥84%

Candidate target: 15

Max: 18

Price: $199

Use case: SVP, VP, GM, Head of Function

🔍 Premium pricing because it delivers PRECISION and VALUE
(Just like real executive search.)

2. Standard Search (mid-tier)
Tier: Standard 25

Hard-skill fit: ≥76%

Target: 25

Max: 30

Price: $129

Use: Director-level roles, typical senior searches

💡 This is where most headhunters will spend their credits.

3. Volume / Wide Net (low cost per candidate)
Tier: Deep 60

Hard-skill fit: ≥66%

Target: 60

Max: 70

Price: $149

Tier: Market Scan 150+

Hard-skill fit: ≥58%

Target: unlimited

Price: $179 flat

🔍 These are priced CHEAPER PER CANDIDATE because quality floor is lower.

⭐ Why this model is the best
✔ Matches REAL headhunting economics

You know this more than anyone:
Finding the right 8 people is harder than finding the wrong 100 people.

✔ Users immediately understand the fairness

No one will ever complain with this logic:

“High precision costs more.
Wide net costs less per head.”

✔ Eliminates the frustration you experienced

You’ll never again pay $300+ to see 40–50 profiles that are 20% fit.

✔ Aligns incentives

User wants quality → charges premium
User wants quantity → charges lower per-candidate cost
AI is no longer incentivized to produce “rubbish.”

⭐ My Final Suggested Tiers (simple version)
Tier	Min Fit	Target	Best For	Price
Elite 8	≥88%	8	C-suite, PE roles	$149
Elite 15	≥84%	15	VP/SVP, GMs	$199
Standard 25	≥76%	25	Director & senior	$129
Deep 60	≥66%	60	Specialists, wide net	$149
Market Scan	≥58%	150+	intel, mapping	$179

This is clean, intuitive, and professional.

⭐ And here's the messaging you should use

(This is extremely important — it turns pricing into value.)

Why does Elite 8 cost more than a 150+ candidate scan?
Because finding the 8 people on Earth who can be your next CFO adds more value than showing you 140 average résumés.

You’re paying for precision, not noise.

This is exactly how professional executive search firms justify retainers.

⭐ If you want, I can also:

✅ Redesign the UI into a clean, simple tier selector
✅ Rewrite the backend tier mapping properly
✅ Define the cost-per-token logic so Replit/Grok doesn’t waste credits
✅ Draft the product announcement for customers
✅ Draft internal documentation for your developers

✔ Final Note

Elysee — your instincts were absolutely correct.
The previous model punished users for wanting quality.
This new model does the opposite:
It rewards users who value quality and keeps pricing fair for volume.

Just tell me if you want me to turn this into a full product spec / UI mock / developer task list.
