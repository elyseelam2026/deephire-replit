DeepHire Search Process: From Client Request to Longlist Delivery
Thank you for outlining the core workflow for DeepHire's candidate search. Based on your description, I've formalized it into a clear, step-by-step process. This ensures consistency, scalability, and alignment with executive search best practices. The goal is always to deliver a longlist of 20-30+ candidates with confidence scores >70%, prioritizing internal sources for speed and relevance, then expanding externally as needed.
I've structured this as:

High-Level Overview: The end-to-end flow.
Detailed Steps: Actionable breakdown with triggers, inputs/outputs, and decision points.
Scoring Integration: How the AI Fit Score and Match Score tie in (from our earlier system).
Implementation Notes for Replit/DeepHire App: How this maps to code and UI for reliability.

This process assumes the "client request" starts via the chat interface in the Dashboard. If data restoration is complete (from our previous conversation), we can trigger a test run immediately.

High-Level Overview
textClient Request (Chat) → NAP Interview → Strategy Formulation → Internal Search → [If <20-30 candidates @ >70% score] → External Search → Longlist Ranking & Delivery

Timeline: 15-45 minutes per search, depending on internal hits.
Success Metric: Longlist delivered with 20-30 candidates, avg. score >75%, with AI reasoning for each.
Fallbacks: If internal yields <10 viable candidates, auto-escalate to external (LinkedIn, referrals, etc.).


Detailed Steps
Here's the process broken down. Each step includes who/what does it, inputs, outputs, and guardrails.






















































StepDescriptionInputsOutputsGuardrails/Decisions1. Receive & Acknowledge RequestClient submits request via chat (e.g., "Find CTO for fintech startup"). AI agent confirms and initiates NAP (Needs Analysis Profile) interview.- Chat message
- Client company profile (from DB)- Confirmation response: "Understood—let's build your ideal profile."
- NAP session started- Auto-log request in DB (new searches table row).
- If vague request, prompt for basics (e.g., "Role? Location?").2. Conduct NAP InterviewAI asks 5-8 targeted questions to build NAP:
- Role urgency/timeline (e.g., "Start date?")
- Success criteria/KPIs (e.g., "Revenue growth targets?")
- Team dynamics/culture fit (e.g., "Remote-first?")
- Must-haves vs. nice-to-haves (e.g., "5+ yrs AI exp?")
AI uses context from client company (e.g., past hires, industry).- Client responses (real-time chat)
- Client company data (from companies table)- Complete NAP profile (JSON: {urgency: "high", kpis: [...], culture: "collaborative"})
- Summary: "Your NAP: CTO with AI focus, Q1 start, culture match to your scale-up vibe."- Limit to 10 Q&A turns max.
- If incomplete, use defaults from company profile.
- Store NAP in DB linked to search ID.3. Formulate Search StrategyAI analyzes NAP + client company understanding to create strategy:
- Keywords: Title, skills, location.
- Filters: Experience level, industry match.
- Sources: Prioritize internal DB, then external.- NAP profile
- Client company insights (e.g., from jobs/companies tables)- Strategy doc (JSON): {keywords: ["CTO", "fintech"], filters: {min_exp: 10}, sources: ["internal", "linkedin"]}
- Shared with client: "Strategy: Target 10+ yr fintech leaders in SF/NY."- Auto-generate 2-3 strategy variants (e.g., broad vs. niche).
- Client approval loop: "Approve or tweak?"4. Execute Internal SearchQuery DeepHire's internal DB for matches.
- Scan candidates table.
- Apply NAP filters.
- Score all hits using two-tier system.
- Aim for 20-30 with >70% confidence.- Search strategy
- Internal DB (candidates, companies, jobs)- Initial longlist: 0-30 candidates with scores.
- Per candidate: Fit Score (0-100), Match Score (0-100), reasoning.
- Progress update: "Found 15 internal matches—scanning deeper."- Decision Point: If ≥20-30 @ >70%, proceed to Step 6.
- If <20, log "Low internal yield" and trigger Step 5.
- Run in background; notify on completion.5. Execute External Search (If Needed)Expand to external sources to fill gaps.
- Sources: LinkedIn search, referrals, public profiles.
- Use strategy keywords/filters.
- Import new candidates to DB.
- Score and dedupe against internal hits.- Gaps from internal search
- External APIs (e.g., LinkedIn via proxy)- Augmented longlist: +10-20 external candidates.
- Total: 20-30+ with >70% scores.
- Import log: "Added 12 from LinkedIn; deduped 3."- Only trigger if internal <20 viable.
- Cap external at 50 queries to avoid rate limits.
- Always score before adding to longlist.6. Rank, Review & Deliver LonglistRank by AI Fit Score (primary), Match Score (tiebreaker).
- Provide transparency: Top 3 strengths, concerns per candidate.
- Client review loop.- Full candidate list with scores- Ranked longlist (UI table/exportable CSV).
- Delivery message: "Your 25-candidate longlist—top fit: Jane Doe (92% 🧠, ex-Google fintech lead)."
- Visuals: Green badges for >70%, sorted descending.- Minimum threshold: Reject any <70%.
- If still short, loop back to Step 3 (refine strategy).
- Archive search in DB for future reference.

Scoring Integration (Two-Tier System)
This process embeds the AI Fit Score (your "WOW Effect") at every search stage for intelligent filtering:

Match Score (⭐, 0-100): Quick keyword baseline (e.g., skills/location match = 80%).
AI Fit Score (🧠, 0-100): NAP-powered deep dive (e.g., "92%—excels in KPIs like 2x revenue growth; concern: remote culture mismatch").
Calculation: xAI Grok API prompt: "Score this candidate [profile] against NAP [details]. Output: score, reasoning, strengths [3], concerns."
Threshold: Only include >70% in longlist. Avg. target: 80%+.

UI/Output: Candidates show as cards with badges, expandable reasoning. Example:textJane Doe | CTO @ FinAI | 🧠 92% | ⭐ 85%
Why: Proven in high-urgency scale-ups like yours.
Strengths: ✓ AI expertise | ✓ Team builder | ✓ KPI driver
Concerns: ⚠️ Limited NY experience

If scores dip below target, the system auto-suggests strategy tweaks (e.g., "Broaden location filter?").

Implementation Notes for Replit/DeepHire App
To make this bulletproof in our app (post-data restore):

DB Schema Updates (Safe Migration Planned):
Add searches table: {id, nap_json, strategy_json, status, created_at}.
Link to candidates via search_id.
No --force: I'll use db:push with schema diffs + manual backups.

Code Flow (In server/routes/search.ts):typescript// Pseudo-code snippet
app.post('/search/start', async (req, res) => {
  const nap = await conductNAP(req.body.request);  // Step 2
  const strategy = formulateStrategy(nap, clientCompany);  // Step 3
  let candidates = await internalSearch(strategy);  // Step 4
  if (candidates.filter(c => c.fitScore > 70).length < 20) {
    candidates = [...candidates, ...(await externalSearch(strategy))];  // Step 5
  }
  const longlist = rankAndFilter(candidates);  // Step 6
  res.json({ longlist, status: 'delivered' });
});
UI Enhancements (Dashboard.tsx):
Chat-triggered: "Start Search" button → NAP modal.
Progress bar: "Internal: 15/20 → External scan..."
Longlist view: Sortable table with scores/export.

Error Handling/Post-Migration:
Always backup: pg_dump before searches.
Test: Once you reply "Data restored", I'll run a mock search with your old November 7th data.
Cost Control: Limit Grok API calls to 10/candidate batch.


This process turns DeepHire into a true "executive search consultant"—proactive, transparent, and client-obsessed. Does this match your vision? Want me to tweak any step, or shall we test it live after restore? (P.S. Still need that "Data restored" confirmation to proceed safely.)
