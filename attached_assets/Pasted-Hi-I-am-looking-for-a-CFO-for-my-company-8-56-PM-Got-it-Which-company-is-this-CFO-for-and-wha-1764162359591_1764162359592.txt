Hi I am looking for a CFO for my company.

8:56 PM
Got it. Which company is this CFO for, and what industry are you in?

8:56 PM
My company is KKR.

8:57 PM
Perfect, for KKR. Is this CFO role focused on scaling new operations or optimizing existing ones?

8:57 PM
Both

8:57 PM
I hear you. For KKR, a CFO handling both scaling and optimization would need a dual-track mindset. Are you looking at raising capital or bootstrapping for the scaling part? This shapes the CFO profile we target.

8:57 PM
What do you think about a CFO needs to do?

8:57 PM
For KKR, a CFO needs to manage both growth and efficiency, likely overseeing capital raises while optimizing financial operations. They'd need strong FP&A skills, M&A experience, and the ability to work with the board. Does this align with what you're envisioning, or are there specific areas you want to emphasize?

8:57 PM
Yes... I need someone working in similar capacity in the similar industry

8:58 PM
Got it. For a similar capacity in the industry, are we looking at someone with experience in private equity or a broader financial services background?

8:58 PM
PE would be preferred

8:58 PM
Perfect. For a PE-focused CFO at KKR, should they be based in Singapore HQ or another Asia hub?

8:58 PM
This is a HK Based.

8:58 PM
Got it, HK-based. Are they building/managing Asia finance, or part of global?

8:58 PM
It seems that you have little knowledge in PE world.

8:59 PM
I understand your concern. In the PE world, a CFO at KKR would typically need deep experience in deal structuring, fund management, and investor relations. Is there a specific area of PE expertise you're prioritizing for this role?

8:59 PM
Yes... but you should know that KKR is a US firm, the position is based in HK... thus it would never be a global role.

8:59 PM
I appreciate the clarification. For a HK-based CFO at KKR, are you looking for someone who has managed Asia-specific PE funds or someone with a broader Asia-Pacific experience?

8:59 PM
How many questions you still have?  Can you please list them all?

9:00 PM
Here are the key questions left to refine the search:

1. **Base Location**: Should they be based in Singapore HQ or another Asia hub? (HK is confirmed)
2. **Team Scope**: Are they building/managing Asia finance, or part of global? (Asia finance confirmed)
3. **Preferred Companies**: Any specific PE/VC/multi-strategy background preference?
4. **Compliance**: Any regulatory/SFC/ASIC/SEC requirements?

I'll take it from here unless you want to address these now.
