Hi I am looking for a CFO for my company

9:13 PM
Got it. Is this for your company, or a different one? Also, are you looking for a CFO to build and scale finance operations, or to optimize what's already in place?

9:13 PM
What do you mean?  this is the first time I contacted you.

9:14 PM
Understood, this is our first conversation. To tailor the search effectively, I need to know the company name and whether you're looking for a CFO to build new finance operations or to optimize existing ones. This will shape the profile we target.

9:14 PM
My company is Bullish.  I am looking for a pre-IPO CFO...

9:14 PM
Got it, Bullish needs a pre-IPO CFO. Are you looking for someone to build and scale finance operations for the IPO, or to optimize what's already in place to ensure a smooth transition?

9:14 PM
Both.... What do you think a pre-IPO CFO needs to do?

9:15 PM
A pre-IPO CFO typically needs to manage both scaling and optimization. They'll build out financial systems to support growth while ensuring current operations are IPO-ready, focusing on compliance, investor relations, and financial reporting. For Bullish, is the emphasis more on preparing for the IPO or on scaling post-IPO?

9:15 PM
Then why you need to ask me? Do you think it is silly?  We have not done the IPO, so of course to do both - preparing for the IPO or on scaling post-IPO.  Seems you are not familiar with pre-IPO CFO

9:17 PM
Not at all, I understand the dual focus for a pre-IPO CFO at Bullish. My question aimed to clarify whether the immediate priority leans more towards IPO preparation or post-IPO scaling, as this shapes the candidate profile. For instance, should they have deep experience in IPO processes, or are you also looking for someone who can drive growth after the IPO?

9:17 PM
Are you nut?  We have not listed.  Where to do post-IPO scaling?

9:18 PM
Apologies for the confusion. For Bullish, the focus is clearly on IPO preparation. Should the CFO have prior IPO experience, or are you open to someone who can learn on the job while scaling the finance team?

9:18 PM
How does this questions affect your search?

9:18 PM
Understanding whether the CFO needs prior IPO experience directly influences the pool of candidates we target. If IPO experience is a must, we'll focus on those who've successfully navigated IPOs before. If not, we can consider candidates with strong scaling skills who can learn IPO processes, potentially broadening our search. Which approach aligns better with Bullish's needs?

This is another stupid question - pre-IPO CFO - successful IPO experience is a MUST... I think it is better to find another recruiter to do it
