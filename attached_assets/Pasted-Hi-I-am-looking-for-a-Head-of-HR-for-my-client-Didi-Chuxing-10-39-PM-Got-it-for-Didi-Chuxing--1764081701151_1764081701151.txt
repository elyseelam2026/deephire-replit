Hi I am looking for a Head of HR for my client, Didi Chuxing.

Got it, for Didi Chuxing. To tailor our search effectively, should the Head of HR be based in Singapore HQ or another Asia hub?

Didi Chuxing HQ is in Beijing, not in Singapore or Asia Hub, why you give the same location for every job?

Apologies for the confusion, I'll update that to Beijing HQ. To better understand the role, what specific skills and experience are you looking for in the Head of HR?

10:40 PM
I think you are asking no up to standard question.  I thought you are an experienced recruiters.  What do you think a Head of HR for a TMT company does?

10:40 PM
I understand your frustration. For a Head of HR at a TMT company like Didi Chuxing, we typically look for expertise in talent acquisition, employee relations, and strategic HR planning. Are you looking for someone with these typical skills, or do you need something different for this role?
