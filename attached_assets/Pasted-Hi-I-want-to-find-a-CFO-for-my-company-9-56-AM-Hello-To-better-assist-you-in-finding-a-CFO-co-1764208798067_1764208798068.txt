Hi I want to find a CFO for my company.

Hello! To better assist you in finding a CFO, could you please tell me the name of your company?

My company is Blackstone.  Have you heard of this company?

Yes, I'm very familiar with Blackstone - one of the largest alternative asset management firms globally, with over $1 trillion in assets under management. Given Blackstone's size and complexity, I understand the CFO role would be a highly strategic position overseeing a diverse range of financial operations across private equity, real estate, credit, and hedge fund solutions.

Let me ask: Are you looking for someone with specific experience in private equity or asset management, or is financial leadership experience in any major industry acceptable?

9:57 AM
Great question - Private Equity or asset management please.

9:57 AM
Thank you for clarifying. Given Blackstone's position as a leading alternative asset manager, we'll focus on candidates with deep experience in either private equity or asset management CFO roles. 

To refine our search further, could you specify if you're looking for someone with a particular geographic focus or if this will be a truly global role?
