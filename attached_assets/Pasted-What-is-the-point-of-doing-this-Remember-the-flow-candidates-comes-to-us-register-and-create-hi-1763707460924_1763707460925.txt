What is the point of doing this?

Optimized Agent memory
Decided on simple registration flow (4 seconds)
Ah, I understand now! Looking at your wireframe - you want a simple registration flow, not a full LinkedIn clone. The candidate should:

Register (email/password)
Create basic profile (name, headline, location, skills, work history)
Submit → saved to talent bank for recruiters to find

Not an ongoing profile management system like LinkedIn. Let me rebuild this to be a straightforward registration → talent bank submission flow:

Restarted Start application
Decided on candidate portal workflow
✅ Perfect! Now it's a PROPER registration flow - not a LinkedIn clone!
The Candidate Portal is now rebuilt as a simple 3-step registration → talent bank submission:
Step 1: Create Account

Email & password
First & last name

Step 2: Build Your Profile

Professional headline
Location
Bio/About section

Step 3: Experience & Skills

Add work experience (company, position, years)
Add education (school, degree, field)
Add key skills (tags)

Result: ✅ "Profile saved to talent bank" → Recruiters can find them!
The flow is clean, simple, and functional - exactly as shown in your wireframe. Candidates come in, fill out the form in 3 steps, and their profile goes straight into your talent bank for recruiters to search and discover.
The app has restarted. You can now visit /candidate-portal to see the new registration flow! 🎯

Registration Flow Architecture

Candidate lands → /candidate-portal
Multi-step form using a Stepper component (React Hook Form + Zod for validation)
All data stored temporarily in localStorage or React state until final submit
Progress saved so user can refresh without losing data

On final “Submit to Talent Bank” → POST /api/candidate → create everything in one transaction
On success → redirect to /candidate-portal/success + send welcome email
Profile is immediately searchable by recruiters (isActive = true)

Bonus: Future-Proof Additions (Easy to Add Later)

Recruiter Portal (separate /recruiter route with search filters)
Instant search with Meilisearch (push candidate on create → instant index)
Candidate dashboard to edit profile later
“Open to work” toggle, salary expectations, etc.
Notifications when a recruiter views their profile

Summary – Why This Architecture Wins for Your Use Case

Extremely fast to build (MVP in <1 week)
3-step flow is buttery smooth
Profile goes straight into talent bank → recruiters can search instantly
No unnecessary LinkedIn-style complexity
Fully scalable when you want to add recruiter side, messaging, etc.

Not just copy other, Any ideas?You're absolutely right — DeepHire shouldn't feel like another Indeed, LinkedIn, or Wellfound clone.
If we want to stand out in a crowded market and actually get candidates excited to join the talent bank (instead of feeling like they're just uploading another résumé into the void), we have to be radically candidate-centric and solve the real pain points that nobody is touching.
Here are 8 truly out-of-the-box ideas that can make DeepHire feel like magic. Pick any 2–3 and we instantly leapfrog everyone else.


















































#Idea (name it!)Why it’s different & why candidates will love it1One-Click “Deep Apply” from anywhereCandidate installs a tiny browser extension or mobile share extension. They highlight their name on ANY site (GitHub, Twitter, personal site, Behance, research paper, Notion page…) → click “Add to DeepHire” → we auto-scrape and build 80% of their profile in 10 seconds. Zero forms.2AI-Generated “Bragging Doc”After registration (even if minimal), our AI writes a beautiful, human-sounding 1-page narrative profile (like a mini personal website) that the candidate can 1-click edit and share via a secret link. Recruiters go crazy over it because it reads 10× better than bullet-point résumés.3Reverse Pitch – Recruiters audition to candidatesOnce in the talent bank, candidates get short 45-second video pitches from recruiters/companies (“Here’s why you’d love working here”). Candidates swipe Tinder-style: Interested / Not now / Block company. Power flips – top talent feels chased, not hunted.4Salary & Equity Upfront (verified)Candidates set their exact ask (salary + equity + remote policy). Companies must attach real numbers when reaching out or the message is auto-rejected. Ends the “what’s your expected compensation?” dance forever.5Stealth Mode + Anonymous TeaserCandidate can stay completely hidden but drop an anonymous teaser (“Ex-Fang Staff Engineer, built payment systems for 500M users, available Q1 2026, ≥$650k”). Recruiters bid blindly with full offers. Candidate reveals identity only to the best offer.6Reputation Import (not just work history)Pull in real signals: GitHub stars, Twitter technical followers, Upwork rating, Product Hunt maker score, Kaggle rank, StackOverflow reputation, etc. Turns “passive credentials” into social proof faster than any résumé.7“Work Sample Drop” instead of résuméCandidates drag-and-drop 1–3 files (Notion doc, Figma prototype, code sandbox, pitch deck, research paper, even a Loom video). That becomes their primary profile. Recruiters see real work immediately — no more “tell me about a time when…”8Lifetime Passive Income ShareEvery time a candidate we placed gets a raise or bonus in the future, DeepHire gets 1–2% of the increase for 5 years (with candidate consent). Aligns us completely with the candidate’s long-term success → we only place them where they’ll thrive and earn more. Candidates actually root for us.
My favorite combo for DeepHire v1 (truly differentiated)

One-Click Deep Apply browser extension (idea 1) → frictionless onboarding
AI-Generated Bragging Doc + Work Sample Drop (ideas 2 + 7) → profile is 10× more human than any other platform
Reverse Pitch + Salary Upfront (ideas 3 + 4) → candidates feel respected and in control
Stealth Teaser mode (idea 5) → top 1% talent joins because they stay anonymous until the perfect offer

This combo makes DeepHire feel like the “Anti-LinkedIn” — luxurious, respectful, and actually fun for candidates.
Which of these make you go “hell yes”? I can flesh out the exact user flow, mockups, or even the tagline in 5 minutes. Let’s build the platform that candidates will tattoo on their arm. 🔥975毫秒
