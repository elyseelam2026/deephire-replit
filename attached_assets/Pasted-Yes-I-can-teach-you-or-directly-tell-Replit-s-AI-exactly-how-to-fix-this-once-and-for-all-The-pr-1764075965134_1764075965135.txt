Yes, I can teach you (or directly tell Replit’s AI) exactly how to fix this once and for all.
The problem is 100% clear from the logs you posted: the system has a deliberate guardrail that blocks ALL candidate searches (even time-bound promises) until all 8 NAP questions are answered.
Here is the precise, minimal fix that will make the system finally deliver instead of just talking.
Step-by-Step Instructions You Can Copy-Paste to Replit AI
Hey Replit AI, please do this exact fix right now:

Open the file server/routes.ts (or wherever the main conversation/post handler lives – it’s the file that contains the line with promiseTriggeredSearch).
Search for this exact block (it’s around line 2900-2910):

TypeScriptconst promiseTriggeredSearch = aiMadePromise && allNAPQuestionsAnswered;
or possibly this variant:
TypeScriptconst promiseTriggeredSearch = aiMadePromise && allNAPQuestionsAnswered === true;

Replace that entire line with this one:

TypeScriptconst promiseTriggeredSearch = aiMadePromise;  // Allow searches on promise even if NAP is incomplete

If there is any other place that has && allNAPQuestionsAnswered in the same condition (within ±30 lines), remove that part too so it also becomes just aiMadePromise.
Also make sure that later in the same function, when you build the search trigger, you are NOT still checking allNAPQuestionsAnswered again. If you see something like:

TypeScriptif (promiseTriggeredSearch && allNAPQuestionsAnswered) {
change it to:
TypeScriptif (promiseTriggeredSearch) {

Save the file and restart the app (or let it hot-reload).
After restart, test immediately:
Go to any client conversation where NAP is incomplete (e.g. 3/8)
Say: “Please get me 10 candidates by 9pm tonight”
The AI should now accept the promise and actually trigger the search + email the longlist instead of suppressing it.


That’s it. This is literally a one-line change that removes the over-protective guardrail that has been causing every single broken promise for the last week.
Bonus (so email actually gets sent too)
While you’re in the file, also make sure this part exists and is being called after candidates are found:
TypeScriptif (candidates.length > 0 && userProvidedEmail) {
  await sendEmailViaSendGrid(userProvidedEmail, generateLonglistHTML(candidates));
}
If sendEmailViaSendGrid is defined but never called in the promise flow, add the call right after the search finishes.
Copy-paste the instructions above to Replit AI word-for-word and it will finally stop lying to you and start delivering candidates. Let me know when it’s done and I’ll help you verify it works.1.7秒
