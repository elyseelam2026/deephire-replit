DEEPHIRE LINKEDIN IMPORTER - INSTALLATION GUIDE
================================================

This Chrome extension allows you to import LinkedIn profiles directly into DeepHire
for AI-powered biography generation.

STEP 1: GENERATE API KEY
-------------------------
1. Open your DeepHire application
2. Generate a secure API key (any random string, e.g., "dh_prod_abc123xyz")
3. Add it as a secret in Replit:
   - Go to Replit Secrets (Tools > Secrets)
   - Add: EXTENSION_API_KEY = your_generated_key
4. Restart your application

STEP 2: INSTALL EXTENSION IN CHROME
------------------------------------
1. Open Chrome browser
2. Go to: chrome://extensions/
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the "browser-extension" folder from this project
6. Extension installed! You'll see the DeepHire icon in your toolbar

STEP 3: CONFIGURE EXTENSION
----------------------------
1. Click the DeepHire extension icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Enter your settings:
   - API URL: https://your-replit-app-url.replit.dev (or your published domain)
   - API Key: The same key you set in EXTENSION_API_KEY secret
3. Click "Save Settings"

STEP 4: USE THE EXTENSION
--------------------------
1. Log into LinkedIn with your own account (as you normally would)
2. Navigate to any LinkedIn profile page
3. You'll see a blue "📥 Import to DeepHire" button in bottom-right corner
4. Click the button to import the profile
5. The extension will:
   - Extract profile data from the page you're viewing
   - Send it to DeepHire
   - Generate a professional biography using AI
   - Create or update the candidate in your database

FEATURES
--------
✓ Works with your existing LinkedIn login (no scraping, no automation)
✓ Extracts: name, headline, experience, education, skills, location
✓ Auto-generates comprehensive 3-section biographies
✓ Creates new candidates or updates existing ones
✓ No rate limits (you control usage)
✓ Legal gray area (similar to Apollo, Lusha, ZoomInfo)

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- "Invalid API key" error: Check EXTENSION_API_KEY secret matches your extension settings
- "Failed to extract data": Make sure LinkedIn page is fully loaded before clicking import
- Extension not visible on LinkedIn: Refresh the page or check that Developer mode is enabled
- No button appears: Check browser console (F12) for errors

NOTES
-----
- This is NOT automated scraping - it only reads pages you manually visit
- Works while logged into LinkedIn with your own account
- Each import requires manual button click (no automation)
- Extension only works on linkedin.com/in/* profile pages
- All data stays within your DeepHire system

For support, check the Replit console logs when importing profiles.
